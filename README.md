Cheat files have `*.cheat.js` extensions. Sometimes there will be more that one cheat file, they will be marked as `*.cheat1.js`, `*.cheat2.js`, `*.cheatN.js` respectively.
If you feel like got lost, please use them as an advice. During the presentation, our teachers will guide you on which one to use.
